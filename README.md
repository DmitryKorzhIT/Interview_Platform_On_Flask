## Interview Platform project with Flask.

:wave:Hello and Welcome,

**In brief:** This repository has been created for the second project on the Python Development course by SoftServe. This project will be written on Python and Flask.

**About the project:** this project will be created for HRs and Experts who work in companies and regularly do job interviews with candidates. While HRs and Experts do an interview, they want to have a standard questions list, they want to choose particular questions for particular interviews, they want to see these questions in front of their eyes, they want to have typical answers on these questions, and they want to evaluate a candidate. The goal of this project is to satisfy all these needs in one website.
